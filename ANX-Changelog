Custom MIUICamera changelog
-------------------------------------------
02/07/2021:
- Initial Release

-------------------------------------------
BUGS (TAKE A LOOK HERE!!)
 - Portrait mode on back lens is dead (After a lot of debugging, it's ANX team fault, so let's wait until they fixes that)
 - Normal shoots with back lenses can not be succesfully processed or hang the camera (Another ANX bug, you can avoid that using Pro Mode)
 - VLOG Mode crashes when recording
 - Clone Mode hangs up when taking photo / recording video
 - Short Video music pick option crashes
 - MiMoji does not work properly caused by some SELinux denials
